# Welcome to my auto-win snake project!

- ### :notebook: Features:
  - Normal snake game with the add of few simple features such as pause, continue, eat, teleport to food , and the main one - auto win
  - Once "H"(auto-win feature) is pressed, the snake enters a Hemiltonian path on the graph in this case the graph is represented by adjacency matrix and because of hemiltonian cycle nature it won't repeat a visited node until completion of cycle, which causes the snake to always win as he will never hit himself.

- ### :globe_with_meridians: Technicals
